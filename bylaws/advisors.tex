\section{Eligibility}
advisors must be a faculty member, a national official, an alumnus of Beta Epsilon with appropriate chapter experience, a graduate student with appropriate chapter experience, or a former chapter president. 

\section{Temporary Advisors}
Temporary advisors may be appointed by the President with the consent of $\frac{2}{3}$rds of the officer corps. Such temporary advisors shall serve until the next Election at which time they will stand for election. Upon confirmation by the officer corps, such advisors will have the rights and privileges of elected advisors. 

\section{Advisor Election}
Advisors shall be elected following the same election procedure as officers, outlined in Appendix~\ref{app:elections} with the position of Advisor considered as an office, except that both the incoming and outgoing president shall be able to comment on the merits of candidates. Since there is not a fixed number of positions for advisors, each advisor is elected individually; a vote to elect shall be considered to have passed if the candidate receives a majority of votes cast.

\section{Advisor Term}
Advisor term length will be subject to motion from the floor as part of the election proceedings. An advisor candidate must indicate his/her preferred term length, and cannot be elected to a term longer than that. The maximum length for an individual term is three years. The term length is considered part of the motion to elect and therefore may be amended by the body. If an advisor fails to receive a majority of votes cast, a motion may be made to elect him/her to a shorter term, to a minimum of one semester.

\begin{enumsubsection}
